Welcome to pySDC's documentation!
=================================

The pySDC project is a Python implementation of the spectral deferred correction (SDC) approach and its flavors,
esp. the multilevel extension MLSDC. It is intended for rapid prototyping and educational purposes. New ideas like e.g
sweepers or predictors can be tested and first toy problems can be easily implemented. Two virtually parallel PFASST
iterators are implemented as well, giving full access to all values at any time.

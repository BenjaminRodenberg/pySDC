This folder gathers various small to medium experiments done with pySDC. They are for example grouped by application (e.g. ``Boris``) or by problem type (e.g. ``ODEs``).
Experiments which become more complex or which eventually evolve into a publication of any form should go to the ``projects`` folder and should receive proper documentation and description.
The codes here are supposed to be cleaned up, but there is no detailed documentation available.
